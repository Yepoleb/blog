title: Reading NFC Data from Austrian Debit Cards

A few months ago I ran across an app called "Bankomat Card Infos" in the F-Droid repository. It can read various information from Austrian debit cards using NFC. At the time I didn't have a bank account, but I recently set one up. The developer of the app has tested Bank Austria and Sparkasse cards. I tried a Raiffeisen debit card and a MasterCard RED. The Raiffeisen card showed some details, the MasterCard doesn't get recognized by the phone. It seems to communicate somehow at least, if you take a look with an oscilloscope and a small wire as antenna. I have never made any real life payments with it, which could be the reason why it doesn't work. If you want to try the app yourself be patient, because the communication was very unreliable and could take a few tries.
