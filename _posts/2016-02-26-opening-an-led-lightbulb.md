title: Opening an LED Lightbulb

I've been nocturnal for a while now and the lamp in my room doesn't seem to like that. It's on for aproximately 6 hours a day and consumes about 1 bpm (bulb per month). Today the first of my new LED bulbs blew and I decided to see what was wrong. It's a 230V 5W LED bulb with a GU10 socket by MÃ¼ller-Licht.

As the first step I removed the plastic cover from the front. It's glued in, but can be easily levered out with a small screwdriver. After that the aluminium plate with the LEDs is revealed. Three of them had a black dot in the middle, which probably indicates that they're dead.

I wanted to dig a bit deeper and tried to get off the heatsink. There was no screwdriver which could fit in between it and the glass shell, so I made my own tool out of a nail.

This didn't work out because the glue was too strong. Fortunately the back is made out of plastic and can be cut with a saw, but I still couldn't get the circuit board out. It's wider on one end to not slip around. At this point I gave up and decided to break the glass body and was finally able to take out the circuit board.

I used my amazing drawing skills to make a quick sketch in Inkscape.
